## What is CodeBandit

CodeBandit is a Node.js based fork of CodeIgniter.  Instead of the overhead of Apache, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan), and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) are used.

I really liked the [Model-View-Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) architectural pattern of CodeIgniter.  Express.js does a fine job of this as well, but I though about porting CodeIgnitor to Node.js just to motivate some folks I know to use Node.js instead of a resource heavy LAMP stack.

For now, MySQL is still a part of this project until I can feel comfortable enough to use MongoDB like with a MEAN stack...only it would probably be more of a MERN (React instead of Angular) or MEVN (Vue.js istead of Angular) stack.

IDK, I may just strip out most of the CodeIgniter stuff all together because of Express's abilities which I'm used to.

## What is CodeIgniter

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.

## Release Information
This repo contained in-development code for future releases of CodeIgniter initially, but I would recommend if you would rather use CodeIgniter to to their website and download a copy at https://codeigniter.com/download 

For now, there is no release yet.

## Server Requirements

The plan is to use Node.js and Express
