# TODO List

* [ ] Find out how to create the Node.js equivalent of `.htaccess` files. [This may help.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17199095/nodejs-equivalent-of-this-htaccess)
* [ ] Figure out how to do staging environemnts. [This may help?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36983023/htaccess-redirect-if-index-php-is-missing?rq=1)
* [ ] Create Access and Error logs like what Apache uses so we can collect information on attempts to breche access on CodeBandit. (Silly Russians! Trix are for kids!) [Forever.js could do this.](https://www.hacksparrow.com/express-js-logging-access-and-errors.html)
* [ ] Hacker-proof Codebandit.  Eventually, they'll learn what Node.js is.  Never assume that they won't figure it out!
* [ ] HTTPS/TLS/SSL Setup!  (Put those Cisco skills to work.)
* [ ] Publish to NPM
* [ ] [Set up Node.js to use MySQL.](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_mysql.asp) (It **really** isn't that complicated...unless you use AWS which will screw you up because of some setting the propbably added that you don't know about. What a P.I.T.A.! Choose Linode or Digital Ocean for Cloud services!)
